 <br> <div style="width:1350px;height:200px;border:5px solid #000;">Hiiii I'm Liya (Lee-yuh) Thomas and I guess you can call me something like a quiet storm, Im very quiet in person if I don't know you. But once you get to know me I don't shut up. But personally I don't like to meet new people I am a very Inside saty in my box person. But as soon as you get to know me I am a Cool, Sweet, fun loving person with a really BIG HEART emphasis on the Big Heart. But my hobbies are eating, sleeping, doing hair, learning dances, and being with my friends. But I have a  BIG passion for doing hair & I plan to become a entrepreneur after I turn 16, and start my company "The Deauviance Collection". But I do also love to dress up but I hate wearing dresses (weird? I know) I also love to go get like my eyebrows done, or a pedicure. But I also hate shopping I honestkt find it boring. I also love to do my hair which shouldn't be a shock since I am aspiring to be a great Hairstylist. I absoulutely LOVE listening to music & dancing are honestly my happy places. I love to hang out also and trying new things. Which is why I was open to taking this course. </div>
 My Honest Opinion on the Code Skools course it was amazing but it was tuff at times and I struggled but I honestly had fun here it was literally the highlight of my summer. Being on this 6 hour zoom call with complete strangers,But it was great everybody has a different perosnality and as everybody got soo cofmartable with each other. I really was a BEAST in the HTML category but as we were going into Javascript and Jquery and stuff like that I started struggling more it was alot to remember and I kept forgetting but I did remember the basics tho. I honestly would take this course again next summer to advance my knowledge in coding because now I see coding isn't just something for nerds its for everybody. No matter what age. Thanks to my great instructors Roger and Frank I love you guys Yall two were the best taught me so much and helped me when I needed it its because of you 2 that I am able to make this website right now. Rating of this class 10/10 Hihgly recommend.
